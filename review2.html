    <h2>Actual Review: Decent</h2>

    <p id="pros">
        Most of the minigames are fairly balanced and every player has the same chances of winning as any other player.
        There are very few cases where a player can pay to win or get an advantage for having played the game more.
        There are cosmetics that the player can buy with coins but these don't tend to be very useful.
        The minigames themselves are mostly dependent on skill and the instructions are brief and clear.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="cons">
    <p>
        There are still some minigames where you can get advantages for paying robux:
        <ul>
            <li>Sword PvP games where you can buy a better sword</li>
            <li>Buying controller for controller minigames guarentees a win</li>
        </ul>
        However, these minigames are just a few of over 100 and don't guarentee a loss for the other players.

        Luck minigames:<br>
        Of course there are going to be some minigames that will have a luck factor and can absolutely destroy you.
        Still, most of these minigames have strategies which can help increase chances of winning.<br><br>
        Examples of some pure-luck games:
        <ul>
            <li>Four Corners: Pick a corner. Every round 1 will fall at random.</li>
            <li>Haunted Hallways: 3 sets of 5 doors, 1 door opens per hall, first through final door wins.</li>
        </ul>
        Of course the ultimate test of luck is getting teammates with >50 IQ on team minigames.
